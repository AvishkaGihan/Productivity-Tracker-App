## 🔗 Integration Points

### Navigation Setup Required

Add to AuthNavigator:

```typescript
<Stack.Screen name="ForgotPassword" component={ForgotPasswordScreen} />
```

### First Launch Check

In App.tsx or auth flow:

```typescript
const onboardingComplete = await AsyncStorage.getItem("onboarding_completed");
if (!onboardingComplete) {
  // Show OnboardingScreen
}
```

### Post-Registration Flow

After successful registration:

```typescript
navigation.navigate("Onboarding");
```

### Retrieve User Goals

In Dashboard or Analytics:

```typescript
const goals = await AsyncStorage.getItem("user_goals");
const userGoals = JSON.parse(goals);
```

## 🎨 Design System Usage

All components follow Phase 1 design system:

- ✅ Theme colors (primary, secondary, gradients)
- ✅ Typography scale (h1-h6, body, caption)
- ✅ Spacing system (4px grid)
- ✅ Shadows and elevation
- ✅ Animation timings
- ✅ Common components (Button, Input, Card)

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. Test complete registration → onboarding → main app flow
2. Test forgot password email sending and confirmation
3. Test onboarding skip saves status correctly
4. Test goal wizard with all steps
5. Test focus area multi-selection
6. Test carousel swipe gestures
7. Test password strength with various inputs
8. Test email validation edge cases
9. Test remember me persistence
10. Test all animations on iOS and Android

### Edge Cases

- Empty form submissions
- Invalid email formats
- Weak passwords
- Password mismatch
- Network failures (simulated)
- Skip onboarding then check storage
- Complete onboarding then check storage

---

## 📝 Notes

- Biometric authentication marked as optional/future feature
- All social login buttons show "Coming Soon" alerts
- Onboarding can be replayed from settings (to be implemented)
- User goals are stored but not yet utilized in app
- Password reset is simulated (no actual email sending)
